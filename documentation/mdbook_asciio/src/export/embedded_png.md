# Asciio embedded in a PNG file

You can save your asciio document as a PNG, it will be recognized by image viewers; that also allows you to have a preview in your file manager.

You need to give the **.pnge** extension to the file you save (please note the final 'e'), this lets asciio know what you want to do. Your file will have the **.png** extension.

When opening a **PNG** file, asciio looks for its data and opens the file if it's present.
